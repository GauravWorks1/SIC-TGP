  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements comprehensively. All 13 requirements have been implemented in the backend (main.mo) and frontend components. The application includes proper authentication, CRUD operations for all sections, and follows the specified design constraints. Generated images are referenced correctly in components. Minor observations: some files were truncated in the diff, but visible evidence suggests complete implementation of all core functionality.",
